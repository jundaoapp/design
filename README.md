# Versioning

This direct (contradiction to the Semantic Versioning)[https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html#spec-item-4] is due to a (bad implementation and limitation in semantic-release)[https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release/issues/1507#issuecomment-605079708].

Versions `2.x.x` and onwards will be considered stable and adhere to the (Semantic Versioning 2.0.0)[https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html].
